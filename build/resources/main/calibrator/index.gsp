      <p>Polley <i>et al.</i> An international study to increase concordance in 
        Ki67 scoring.</p>
      <p>This web-based calibration exercise was designed to calibrate pathologists 
        to a prescribed scoring method. Nine “training” and nine 
        “test” tissue microarray cases representing a wide range of Ki67 scores were 
        chosen to serve as the calibration cases.</p>
      <p>This website interface allows pathologists to score the web-image cores 
        via computer mouse click on individual cells. The website software 
        tracks which cells were scored, where those cells were located within 
        the core, whether each cell was scored positive or negative, and the 
        overall Ki67 score for each core. Images of H&E-stained sections from 
        the cores were also uploaded for reference. </p>
      <p>The specific Ki67 scoring procedure is described in detail <a href='${grailsApplication.config.grails.serverURL_noAppName+ViewConstants.KI67_QC_CALIBRATOR_METHOD_LINK}'>here <img src='${resource(dir:'images/skin',file:'pdf_icon.jpg')}'/></a>.</p>
